# Copy Cat (2-day hackathon!)

## Objective:

Replicate the BBC Sport ‚öΩÔ∏è home page (https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport) in all of its glorious detail using CSS and HTML (bonus tasks include Javascript).

## Why:

Taking a design, breaking it down, and quickly scaffolding out a page is an important skill to have. It‚Äôs also a brilliant way to build those CSS and HTML muscles. This is about building fast and getting fluent.

## Main Tasks:

Note: this is about building quickly and having fun. In the main tasks leave out things like icons, interactivity (like menus that open) or any animations. For the main tasks I want you to re-create the mobile version of the site, not the desktop version. Don‚Äôt move on to the Bonus Tasks until the visual side is spot on! üëÄ

- **Visually re-create the BBC Sport home page as a ‚Äúlow fidelity‚Äù version first.**
    - Replicate the layout of the page and get the sizing and spacing right.
    - Replicate the elements in the layout very roughly.
        - This means create a ‚ÄúNews Card‚Äù - but to start with just make it a big grey block maybe.
        - Make the logo and icons in the header grey blocks.
- **Add in the detail (high-fidelity, make it look real).**
    - Focus element by element on creating things in ‚Äúhigh fidelity‚Äù.
        - Make the header look exactly like the real thing.
        - Then make the ‚ÄúFeatured News Card‚Äù look exactly right.
        - Then make the footer look exactly like the real thing.
        - Fonts - this could be challenging. Don‚Äôt get stuck - use a Google Font or something else if you can‚Äôt ‚Äúborrow‚Äù the BBC one.

## Bonus Tasks (choose one):

- **Add interactivity.**
    - Add some interactivity by making both of the menus in the navigation actually work. This will require event listeners (clicks) and DOM manipulation (adding classes) to show/hide things.
- **Make it work on desktop too**
    - Make your design responsive by using Media Queries in your CSS. When you resize your page to a desktop size it should look the same as the BBC Sport home page in desktop.

## How:

- Understand the BBC Sport home page and start to try and break it down.
    - Look for sections.
    - Look for patterns and repetition.
    - Look for common components.
- Use the Google Chrome Inspect Tool - this is your best friend. Get used to looking at the HTML structure and CSS of the BBC Sport page for tips on how they did it. You can see the exact spacing and size they use.

- Create a basic index.html and styles.css files. Link them together and work out how you‚Äôre going to view it in the browser.
